# The Jester's Library

A simple web application designed to provide easy access to various special characters I frequently use for class or design purposes. Users can search for symbols, view their HTML codes and Unicode values, and copy them to their clipboard with a single click. This tool is particularly useful for writers, designers, and developers who frequently use these characters in their work.
